# As a Mentee

- Is exercism the right platform for me?
  -> it is great for learning your **second** language
  -> requires some experience with using the command line
- learning new languages is difficult because you have to **unlearn** a lot in order to gain idiomatic proficiency
  -> exercism mentors help with this
- comparing your solutions to those of other mentees (and reading the related discussions) helps **a lot**
- working on your own machine, using your own tools
- connects to mentors you otherwise might not have access to
- lets you explore in a safe environment
- teaches test-driven development
