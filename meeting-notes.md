# As a Mentee

- Is exercism the right platform for me?
  -> it is great for learning your **second** language
  -> requires some experience with using the command line
- learning new languages is difficult because you have to **unlearn** a lot in order to gain idiomatic proficiency
  -> exercism mentors help with this
- comparing your solutions to those of other mentees (and reading the related discussions) helps **a lot**
- working on your own machine, using your own tools
- connects to mentors you otherwise might not have access to
- lets you explore in a safe environment
- teaches test-driven development

# As a Mentor

- being able to identify with the values and mission statement
- lets you leverage your skills by helping many mentees at once
- easy entry because of community mentor notes
- recap core concepts
- get to know different view points, learn from mistakes you might've not made yourself
- help at your own pace without being rushed (compared to classroom setting)
