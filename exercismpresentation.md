# While this improved a lot of things, it made **knowledge transfer** more difficult.

---

# To counter this, I proposed the format of **remote coding dojos** using Exercism.

---

# [fit] Why Exercism?

- lots of exercises at **different levels of difficulty**
- **clearly defined** tasks
- infrastructure for **async discussion**

---

# [fit] How does it work?

---

# Each session has a **theme**, like **algorithms** or **datastructures**.

---

# We start by **introducing** the exercises, with an emphasise on **what to learn** and **what to watch out for**.

---

# Depending on the group size, we work **in pairs** or **as a mob**[^3].

---

# We set aside **30 minutes** each for **solving the exercises** and **discussing the solutions** afterwards.

---

# **Following** each session, the Exercism platform can be used to **discuss open points**.

---
