# [fit] Agenda

1. What is exercism.io?
1. As a Mentee
1. As a Mentor
1. As a Team

^ My agenda: First I will give you some background on Exercism, then I present you my three perspectives on the platform: As a mentee, as a mentor, and as a member of a remote team.

---

> Exercism is an online coding platform that offers code practice and mentorship.
-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercism)

^ Let us kick things off with what Exercism is, exactly. Quoting Wikipedia: :up:

---

![](img/tim-gouw-racetrack.jpg)

# Where other online coding platforms are about challenges and competition, Exercism focusses on **community and compassion**.

[.footer: Photo by [Tim Gouw](https://unsplash.com/@punttim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: You won't find a public leaderboard on Exercism. Neither will people intentionally obfuscate their results to gain an advantage. Instead you will be welcomed by friendly mentors and lively discussion sections.

---

# [fit] Exercism has

- A community of **330k users** in **200 countries**
- A group of **2.5k mentors** in **29 timezones**
- A variety of curated exercises in **50 programming languages**

# [fit] As a Mentee

^ Let me now tell you how I settled on Exercism for learning new programming languages and how it helped me learning to write idiomatic code faster.

---

![](img/iana-dmytrenko-learning-child.jpg)

# As I got **started with coding**, I was **on my own** and struggled with **long feedback loops**.

[.footer: Photo by [Iana Dmytrenko](https://unsplash.com/@yasya?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/learning-child?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: My first real programming language was MATLAB, which I learned without much guidance in my last year of undergrad studies. Everything confused me. I had to wait a week to get feedback from my maths tutor.

---

![](img/jukan-tateisi-start.jpg)

# I didn't know **where to start**.

# Or **how**.

^ :up: I didn't really know how to grow as a programmer. I did some tutorials, but didn't know how to continue from there.

---

![](img/prophsee-journals-habits.jpg)

# As I tried **new languages**, I had trouble unlearning **old habits**.

^ Once I got a bit of confidence with MATLAB, I wanted to look further. By chance I learned about Python and liked it a lot, so I spent a lot of time reading books and blogs about it. After a few weeks of learning Python, my code still looked a lot like MATLAB. In general: :up:

![](img/exercismlogo.png)

[.footer: Logo by [Exercism](https://assets.exercism.io/social/general.png)]

^ At my first job, a colleague recommended me to use a platform called Exercism. This would help me improving my programming skills a lot. But how?

![](img/joshua-ness-mentor.jpg)

# Exercism mentors will **support** you and guide you to **idiomatic code**.

^ Firstly: Mentors! :up: Mentors are there to answer your questions and to point out how to write better code. Keep in mind they are volunteers that want you to excel. :smile:

---

![](img/annie-spratt-test.jpg)

# Each exercise comes with a **test suite** for **immediate feedback**.

^ Secondly: Tests! :up: When you download an exercise using the Exercism CLI, you will also get a test suite. The tests will help you find a working solution using test-driven development.

![](img/delaney-van-weights.jpg)

# The **Go track** comes with **109 exercises**[^3] of varying difficulty.

# It starts with **Hello World** and extends your knowledge **little by little**.

^ :up: The exercises cover a lot of ground, including concurrency and data structures.

---

# [fit] Mentee Guide

To get the most out of Exercism:

1. Ask you mentors **all the questions**.
2. **Compare your solutions** to those of other mentees.
3. **Explore** the language in the safe environment.

^ :up: Even if they are only partially related to the current exercise. 
:up: You can look at the community solutions for each exercise. Often those with a lot of stars or comments are worth comparing to.
:up: You don't have to fear anything while experimenting with Exercism.

# [fit] As a Mentor

^ In the next section I want to tell you how mentoring on Exercism profitted me personally :up:

![](img/shubhan-sharan-teaching.jpg)

# After being a **teaching assistant** at university, I wanted to keep on mentoring, but **didn't have the time** for in-person classes.

---

> We envision a world where **anyone from any background** can become fluent in any programming language for free. Through programming exercises, resources and a **safe and nurturing community**.
-- [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/values)

^ :up: As a mentor, it is your main objective to foster this safe and nurturing community. Be compassionate, welcoming, and patient!

---

![](img/oxa-roxa-humble.jpg)

# Mentoring on Exercism is a great way of becoming a **better developer** and a **humble teacher**.

[.footer: Photo by [Oxa Roxa](https://unsplash.com/@oxaroxa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/humble?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: You will likely see approaches to tasks you would've never thought of. Sometimes these approaches can be a bit unexpected, so take your time to guide your mentees to an idiomatic solution. :bee:

---

![](img/david-travis-notes.jpg)

# Great **community mentor notes** are there to help you out when in doubt.

[.footer: Photo by [David Travis](https://unsplash.com/@dtravisphd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/notes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: I cannot stress enough how much the mentor notes have helped me: They cover feedback to the most frequently submitted approaches, as well as background information you can share with your mentees.

---

![](img/dmitry-schemelev-pace.jpg)

# Because of the **asynchronous** nature of the platform, you can mentor at your **own pace**.

[.footer: Photo by [Dmitry Schemelev](https://unsplash.com/@enioku?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/walking?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)

^ :up: You are not expected to respond as soon as possible. You don't have to fulfill a quota to be valid. Just pick a solution from the queue and start mentoring. :smile:

---

# [fit] Mentor Guide

How to be a supportive mentor:

1. Be **humble and patient**.
2. Make use of the **community mentor notes**.
3. **Don't rush** yourself!

^ :up: If you are surprised by a solution, don't force it to look like your expected solution immediately. Go with your mentee's approach until it works for both of you.
:up: If in doubt, check how more experienced mentors have solved teaching this exercise.
:up: Don't try to mentor 10 mentees at once, especially in the beginning. Go slowly, improve steadily.

# [fit] As a Team

^ In the remaining time I want to share with you how we are using Exercism at my company :up:

---

![fit](img/real-digital-remote-first.jpg)

# In August 2020, real.digital decided to go **remote-first**.

![](img/markus-winkler-stick.jpg)

# While it made life easier in general, it made **knowledge transfer** more difficult.

^ :up: Especially the onboarding of new hires requires a different approach compared to colocated teams. Getting into the same pace takes more time and effort.

---

![](img/thao-le-hoang-dojo.jpg)

# To counter this, I proposed the introduction of **remote coding dojos** using Exercism:

> A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get **together** to work on a programming **challenge**. They are there to have **fun** and to engage in deliberate practice in order to **improve** their skills.
-- [codingdojo.org](https://codingdojo.org/WhatIsCodingDojo/)

[.footer: Photo by [Thao Le Hoang](https://unsplash.com/@h4x0r3?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/martial-arts?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ We realised quickly that pair programming helped with some of the previously mentioned difficulties. But while pair programming facilitated the collaboration between two team members, it didn't work for the whole team. :up:
To quote from codingdojo.org: :up:

---

# [fit] Why Exercism?

1.  **free** Teams Edition
2.  lots of exercises at **different levels of difficulty**
3.  **clearly defined** tasks
4.  infrastructure for **async discussion** 

^ :up: The Teams Edition lets your team work in a closed environment. Your solutions and discussions won't be shared with the outside world.
:up: Reach your team members exactly where they are in their current Go journey.
:up: Don't waste your time defining the parameters of your exercises
:up: Continue discussing your solutions even after the synchronous meeting has ended.

^ Approaching Exercism as a team is different compared to using it as an individual user. So :up:

---

![](img/yaopey-yong-theme.jpg)

# Each session has a **theme**, like **algorithms** or **data structures**.

[.footer: Photo by [Yaopey Yong](https://unsplash.com/@yaopey?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/theme?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: Depending on the group size, prepare up to three different exercises upfront. The fewer you pick, the more details you can discuss later.

---

![](img/milan-de-clercq-sign.jpg)

# We start by **introducing** the exercises, with an emphasise on what **to learn** and what **to watch out for**.

[.footer: Photo by [Milan De Clercq](https://unsplash.com/@mdc_photography2000?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/watch-out?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: Balance between spoiling too much and telling too little. Sometimes having a good preparation makes it easier for newbies to choose the exercise that is fitting them best.

---

![](img/ratapan-anantawat-crowd.jpg)

# Depending on the group size, we work **in pairs** or **as a mob**[^4].

[.footer: Photo by [Ratapan Anantawat](https://unsplash.com/@rtp_atw?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/shibuya-crossing?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: Decide this based on your team. If you have introverts in your team, sticking to pair programming might be easier. 

---

![](img/marco-leal-timer.jpg)

# We set aside **30 minutes** each for **solving** the exercises and **discussing** the solutions afterwards.

^ :up: Point out clearly when to rejoin for the discussions. I usually start a timer on my smartphone and announce the remaining time in our Slack channel frequently.

---

![](img/akson-discussion.jpg)

# **Following** each session, the Exercism platform can be used to **discuss open points**.

[.footer: Photo by [Akson](https://unsplash.com/@akson?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/discussion?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)]

^ :up: Discussion is the most vital part of a coding dojo. Motivate your team to continue discussing using the Exercism platform.

---

# [fit] Team Guide

1. Choose a **theme** and pick suiting **exercises**
3. Emphasise **learning outcomes**
4. **30 minutes** each of **coding and discussion**
6. ...
7. Profit!

^ To sum it up: :up:

---

# [fit] Executive Summary

Exercism is 

- an **open and welcoming** coding platform.
- **benefitting** mentees and mentors alike.
- great for **knowledge sharing** and **team building**.

^ If there are only three points you take away from this talk, these should be: :up:
