# As a Mentee

- well documented
- working on your own machine, using your own tools
- connects to mentors you otherwise might not have access to
- lets you explore in a safe environment
- teaches test-driven development

---

# As a Mentor

- lets you leverage your skills by helping many mentees at once
- easy entry because of community mentor notes
- recap core concepts
- get to know different view points, learn from mistakes you might've not made yourself
- help at your own pace without being rushed (compared to classroom setting)

---

## As a Team

- I introduced Exercism in my product area for remote code dojos
- convenient infrastructure for async discussion
- lots of tasks at different levels
- clearly defined tasks allow to concentrate on solving instead of discussing surrounding conditions
