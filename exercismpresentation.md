# [fit] As a Mentee

---

# I grew up learning new things being **on my own** and with **long feedback loops**.

---

# After finding out about online coding platforms, I often ditched learning a language **idiomatically** in favour of **performance** and **leader boards**.

---

# You often have to **unlearn old habits** in order to write **idiomatic code** when learning a **new language**.
---

# Exercism and its short feedback loop based on **human mentors** and **test-driven development** provides for a welcome change. 

---

# Is Exercism the **right platform** for me?

---

# It is great for learning your **second language**, as the exercises do not teach **programming concepts** explicitly.

---

# In addition, you should be comfortable using the **command line**.

---

# [fit] As a Mentor

---

# After being a **teaching assistant** at university, I wanted to keep on mentoring, but **didn't have the time** for in-person classes.

---

# I was looking for an **open community** where I could help mentoring **all people**, regardless of their backgrounds.

---

# Mission Statement

> To enable anyone to achieve fluency in any programming language for free, in order to give opportunity to all and improve the quality of software development worldwide.

# Values

> We envision a world where anyone from any background can become fluent in any programming language for free. Through programming exercises, resources and a safe and nurturing community.

# As a Mentor

- being able to identify with the values and mission statement
- lets you leverage your skills by helping many mentees at once
- easy entry because of community mentor notes
- recap core concepts
- get to know different view points, learn from mistakes you might've not made yourself
- help at your own pace without being rushed (compared to classroom setting)

---

## As a Team

- I introduced Exercism in my product area for remote code dojos
- convenient infrastructure for async discussion
- lots of tasks at different levels
- clearly defined tasks allow to concentrate on solving instead of discussing surrounding conditions
